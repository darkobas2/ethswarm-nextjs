          title: Swarm Grant Waves
          content: >-
            Swarm grant waves enable developers, researchers, the community,
            and artists to familiarise themselves with Swarm by creating
            proofs-of-concept and minimum viable products (MVPs) that reflect
            their vision. The initial grants mark the beginning of collaboration,
            and those who achieve their milestones successfully are eligible
            to apply for subsequent grants.


            If you have any questions regarding the process, reach out to a
            Swarm team member on the official [Swarm Discord server](https://discord.gg/wV5sm2bkhF).
